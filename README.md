Project Overview

This project involves creating a dynamic React application that displays a list of events with filtering options. 
The application showcases advanced React concepts and utilizes Chakra UI to create a modern and visually 
appealing user interface. Users can search for events, filter them based on categories, and add new events through a modal form.
The application fetches event data from an API and allows users to navigate to individual event pages for more details. 
Additionally, users have the ability to add, edit, and delete events using a modal.
